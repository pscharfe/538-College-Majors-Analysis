# Clustering-College-Majors-in-Python
* Dataset from the data journalism website fivethirtyeight, listing college majors, associated demographic data, and their economic outcomes, e.g., income, employment, etc.
* Data includes only recent BA/BS graduates to get an up-to-date view of current economic outcomes
* Begins with correlations, visualizations, and multiple linear regressions
* Several new variables are constructed, e.g., share of recent grads working part-time
* Two algorithms (K-Means and K--Nearest Neighbor) used to build clusters of majors
* Loops with various validation methods to find the optimal number of clusters
